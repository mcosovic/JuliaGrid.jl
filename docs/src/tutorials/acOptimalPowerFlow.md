# [AC Optimal Power Flow](@id ACOptimalPowerFlowTutorials)
To begin, let us generate the `PowerSystem` type, as illustrated by the following example:
```@example ACOptimalPowerFlow
using JuliaGrid # hide
using JuMP, Ipopt
@default(unit) # hide
@default(template) # hide

@config(label = Integer)

system = powerSystem()

@bus(minMagnitude = 0.95, maxMagnitude = 1.05)
addBus!(system; label = 1, type = 3, active = 0.1, angle = -0.1)
addBus!(system; label = 2, reactive = 0.01, magnitude = 1.1)

@branch(minDiffAngle = -pi, maxDiffAngle = pi, reactance = 0.5, type = 1)
addBranch!(system; label = 1, from = 1, to = 2, maxFromBus = 0.15, maxToBus = 0.15)

@generator(maxActive = 0.5, minReactive = -0.1, maxReactive = 0.1)
addGenerator!(system; label = 1, bus = 1, active = 0.4, reactive = 0.2)
addGenerator!(system; label = 2, bus = 2, active = 0.2, reactive = 0.1)

cost!(system; generator = 1, active = 2, polynomial = [900.0; 500.0; 80.0; 5.0])
cost!(system; generator = 2, active = 1, piecewise =  [10.8 12.3; 14.7 16.8; 18 18.1])

cost!(system; generator = 1, reactive = 1, piecewise = [10.0 20.0; 20.0 40.0])
cost!(system; generator = 2, reactive = 2, polynomial = [2.0])
nothing # hide
```

To review, we can conceptualize the bus/branch model as the graph denoted by ``\mathcal{G} = (\mathcal{N}, \mathcal{E})``, where we have the set of buses ``\mathcal{N} = \{1, \dots, n\}``, and the set of branches ``\mathcal{E} \subseteq \mathcal{N} \times \mathcal{N}`` within the power system:
```@repl ACOptimalPowerFlow
ùí© = collect(keys(system.bus.label))
‚Ñ∞ = [ùí©[system.branch.layout.from] ùí©[system.branch.layout.to]]
```

Moreover, we identify the set of generators as ``\mathcal{S} = \{1, \dots, n_\mathrm{g}\}`` within the power system:
```@repl ACOptimalPowerFlow
ùíÆ = collect(keys(system.generator.label))
```

---

!!! ukw "Notation"
    Here, when referring to a vector ``\mathbf{a}``, we use the notation ``\mathbf{a} = [a_{i}]`` or ``\mathbf{a} = [a_{ij}]``, where ``a_i`` represents the element related with bus ``i \in \mathcal{N}`` or generator ``i \in \mathcal{S}``, while ``a_{ij}`` denotes the element related with branch ``(i,j) \in \mathcal{E}``.

---

## [Optimal Power Flow Model](@id ACOptimalPowerFlowModelTutorials)
In the AC optimal power flow model, the active and reactive power outputs of the generators, denoted as ``\mathbf P_{\mathrm{g}} = [P_{\mathrm{g}i}]`` and ``\mathbf Q_{\mathrm{g}} = [Q_{\mathrm{g}i}]``, where ``i \in \mathcal S``, are expressed as nonlinear functions of the bus voltage magnitudes and angles, denoted as ``\mathbf V = [V_i]`` and ``\bm{\Theta} = [\theta_i]``, where ``i \in \mathcal N``. Consequently, the optimization variables encompass the active and reactive power outputs of the generators, as well as the bus voltage magnitudes and angles.

The AC optimal power flow problem can be formulated as follows:
```math
\begin{aligned}
    & \text{minimize} & &  \sum_{i \in \mathcal S} \left[f_i(P_{\mathrm{g}i}) + f_i(Q_{\mathrm{g}i}) \right] \\[10pt]
    & \text{subject to} & & \\[-4pt]
    & & &  \left.
    \begin{aligned}
        & \theta_i - \theta_\mathrm{s} = 0
    \end{aligned}
    \phantom{\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;}
    \right\} i \in \mathcal{N_\mathrm{sb}} \\[-1pt]
    & & & \left.
    \begin{aligned}
        & h_{P_i}(\mathbf P_\mathrm{g}, \mathbf V, \bm \Theta) = 0  \\
        & h_{Q_i}(\mathbf Q_\mathrm{g}, \mathbf V, \bm \Theta) = 0  \\
        & V_{i}^\mathrm{min} \leq V_i \leq V_{i}^\mathrm{max}
    \end{aligned}
    \phantom{\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;}
    \right\} i \in \mathcal N \\[8pt]
    & & &  \left.
    \begin{aligned}
        & \theta_{ij}^\mathrm{min} \leq \theta_i - \theta_j \leq \theta_{ij}^\mathrm{max}  \\
        & F_{ij}^{\mathrm{min}} \leq h_{ij}(\mathbf V, \bm \Theta) \leq F_{ij}^{\mathrm{max}}  \\
        & F_{ji}^{\mathrm{min}} \leq h_{ji}(\mathbf V, \bm \Theta) \leq F_{ji}^{\mathrm{max}}
    \end{aligned}
    \phantom{\;\;}
    \right\} (i,j) \in \mathcal E \\[8pt]
    & & &  \left.
    \begin{aligned}
        & P_{\mathrm{g}i}^\mathrm{min} \leq P_{\mathrm{g}i} \leq P_{\mathrm{g}i}^\mathrm{max}  \\
        & Q_{\mathrm{g}i}^\mathrm{min} \leq Q_{\mathrm{g}i} \leq Q_{\mathrm{g}i}^\mathrm{max}
    \end{aligned}
    \phantom{\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;}
    \right\} i \in \mathcal S
\end{aligned}
```


In essence, the AC optimal power flow aims to minimize the objective function associated with the costs of generator's active and reactive power output while ensuring the fulfillment of all constraints. This optimization task plays a pivotal role in effectively managing electrical power systems. By striking a balance between cost reduction and constraint adherence, the AC optimal power flow contributes to efficient and reliable electricity supply in complex grid environments.

---

##### Build Optimal Power Flow Model
To build the AC optimal power flow model, we must first load the power system and establish the AC model:
```@example ACOptimalPowerFlow
acModel!(system)
nothing # hide
```

Afterward, the AC optimal power flow model is created using the [`acOptimalPowerFlow`](@ref acOptimalPowerFlow) function:
```@example ACOptimalPowerFlow
analysis = acOptimalPowerFlow(
  system, Ipopt.Optimizer; active = "Pg", reactive = "Qg", magnitude = "V", angle = "Œ∏"
)
nothing # hide
```

---

##### Optimization Variables
The variables within this model encompass the active and reactive power outputs of the generators, denoted as ``\mathbf P_\mathrm{g} = [P_{\mathrm{g}i}]`` and ``\mathbf Q_\mathrm{g} = [Q_{\mathrm{g}i}]``, where ``i \in \mathcal S``, and the bus voltage magnitudes and angles represented by ``\mathbf V = [V_i]`` and ``\bm \Theta = [\theta_i]``, where ``i \in \mathcal N``. We can access these variables using the following code:
```@repl ACOptimalPowerFlow
ùêè‚Çí = analysis.method.variable.active
ùêê‚Çí = analysis.method.variable.reactive
ùêï = analysis.method.variable.magnitude
ùöØ = analysis.method.variable.angle
```

---

## Objective Function
The objective function represents the sum of the active and reactive power cost functions ``f_i(P_{\mathrm{g}i})`` and ``f_i(Q_{\mathrm{g}i})``, where ``i \in \mathcal S``, for each generator, where these cost functions can be polynomial or piecewise linear. Typically, the AC optimal power flow focuses on minimizing the cost of active power outputs only, but for comprehensive analysis, we also consider the costs associated with reactive power outputs.

---

##### Polynomial Cost Function
In the following analysis, we will focus on the cost function of generating active power, denoted as ``f_i(P_{\mathrm{g}i})``. However, please note that the same analysis can be applied to the cost function ``f_i(Q_{\mathrm{g}i})`` for reactive power.

In the AC optimal power flow, the cost function ``f_i(P_{\mathrm{g}i})`` can be represented as an ``m``-th degree polynomial:
```math
f_i(P_{\mathrm{g}i}) = \sum_{k=0}^m a_k P_{\mathrm{g}i}^k.
```

Typically, cost functions are represented as linear, quadratic, or cubic, as shown in Figure 1:
```math
\begin{aligned}
  f_i(P_{\mathrm{g}i}) &= a_1 P_{\mathrm{g}i} + a_0 \\
  f_i(P_{\mathrm{g}i}) &= a_2 P_{\mathrm{g}i}^2 + a_1 P_{\mathrm{g}i} + a_0 \\
  f_i(P_{\mathrm{g}i}) &= a_3 P_{\mathrm{g}i}^3 + a_2 P_{\mathrm{g}i}^2 + a_1P_{\mathrm{g}i} + a_0. \\
\end{aligned}
```

</div>
&nbsp;
```

When using the [`cost!`](@ref cost!) function in JuliaGrid and specifying the `polynomial` keyword, the polynomial is constructed with coefficients arranged in descending order of their degrees, from the highest degree to the lowest. For example, in the case study provided, we generated a cubic polynomial cost function for the active output power of `Generator 1`, which is represented as:
```math
\begin{aligned}
  f_1(P_{\mathrm{g}1}) &= 900 P_{\mathrm{g}1}^3 + 500 P_{\mathrm{g}1}^2 + 80 P_{\mathrm{g}1} + 5.
\end{aligned}
```
To access these coefficients, users can utilize the variable:
```@repl ACOptimalPowerFlow
f‚ÇÅ = system.generator.cost.active.polynomial[1]
```

---

##### Piecewise Linear Cost Function
The second option for defining cost functions in the AC optimal power flow is to use piecewise linear functions as approximations of the polynomial functions, as illustrated in Figure 2.
```@raw html
<div class="image-container">
    <div class="image-item-three">
        <img src="../../assets/cost_function_piecewise_one.svg" width="85%"/>
        <p>(a) One-segment function.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="image-item-three">

        <p>(b) Two-segment function.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="image-item-three">
        <img src="../../assets/cost_function_piecewise_three.svg" width="85%"/>

    </div>
    <p style="text-align: center; margin-top: -5px;">
    Figure 2: Different types of piecewise linear cost functions that are typically used.
    </p>
</div>
&nbsp;
```

To define piecewise linear functions in JuliaGrid, users can utilize the [`cost!`](@ref cost!) function with the `piecewise` keyword. The piecewise linear function is constructed using a matrix where each row defines a single point. The first column holds the generator's active or reactive power output, while the second column corresponds to the associated cost value. For example, in the provided case study, a piecewise linear function is created and can be accessed as follows:
```@repl ACOptimalPowerFlow
f‚ÇÇ = system.generator.cost.active.piecewise[2]
```

JuliaGrid handles convex piecewise linear functions using a constrained cost variable method. In this approach, the piecewise linear cost function is replaced by a helper variable and a set of linear inequality constraints for each segment of the function defined by two neighboring points along the line. However, for piecewise linear functions that have only one segment defined by two points, JuliaGrid transforms it into a standard linear function without introducing a helper variable.

Hence, for a piecewise cost function denoted as ``f_i(P_{\mathrm{g}i})`` with ``k`` segments (where ``k > 1``), the ``j``-th segment, defined by the points ``[P_{\mathrm{g}i,j}, f_i(P_{\mathrm{g}i,j})]`` and ``[P_{\mathrm{g}i,j+1}, f_i(P_{\mathrm{g}i,j+1})]``, is characterized by the following inequality constraints:
```math
\cfrac{f_i(P_{\mathrm{g}i,j+1}) - f_i(P_{\mathrm{g}i,j})}{P_{\mathrm{g}i,j+1} - P_{\mathrm{g}i,j}}(P_{\mathrm{g}i} - P_{\mathrm{g}i,j}) + f_i(P_{\mathrm{g}i,j}) \leq H_i, \;\;\; i \in \mathcal{S}, \;\;\; j = 1,\dots,k,
```
where ``H_i`` represents the helper variable. To finalize this method, we simply need to include the helper variable ``H_i`` in the objective function. This approach efficiently handles piecewise linear cost functions, providing the flexibility to capture nonlinear characteristics while still benefiting from the advantages of linear optimization techniques.

As an example, in the provided case study, the helper variable is defined as follows:
```@repl ACOptimalPowerFlow
H‚ÇÇ = analysis.method.variable.actwise[2]
```

Lastly, the set of constraints introduced by the piecewise linear cost function is displayed as follows:
```@repl ACOptimalPowerFlow
print(analysis.method.constraint.piecewise.active)
```

---

##### Objective Function
As previously explained, the objective function relies on the defined polynomial or piecewise linear cost functions and represents the sum of these costs. In the provided example, the objective function that must be minimized to obtain the optimal values for the active and reactive power outputs of the generators and the bus voltage magnitudes and angles can be accessed using the following:
```@repl ACOptimalPowerFlow
JuMP.objective_function(analysis.method.jump)
```

---

## Constraint Functions
In the following section, we will examine the various constraints defined within the AC optimal power flow model.

---

##### Slack Bus Constraint
The first equality constraint is linked to the slack bus, where the bus voltage angle denoted as ``\theta_i`` is fixed to a constant value ``\theta_\mathrm{s}``. It can be expressed as follows:
```math
\theta_i - \theta_\mathrm{s} = 0,\;\;\; i \in \mathcal{N_{\mathrm{sb}}},
```
where the set ``\mathcal{N}_{\mathrm{sb}}`` contains the index of the slack bus. To access the equality constraint from the model, we can utilize the variable:
```@repl ACOptimalPowerFlow
print(analysis.method.constraint.slack.angle)
```

---

##### Bus Power Balance Constraints
The second equality constraint in the optimization problem is associated with the active power balance equation:
```math
\begin{aligned}
h_{P_i}(\mathbf P_{\mathrm{g}}, \mathbf V, \bm \Theta) = 0,\;\;\;  i \in \mathcal N.
\end{aligned}
```

As elaborated in the [Bus Injections](@ref BusInjectionsTutorials) section, we can express the equation as follows:
```math
h_{P_i}(\mathbf P_\mathrm{g}, \mathbf V, \bm \Theta) = V_i \sum\limits_{j=1}^n (G_{ij}\cos\theta_{ij} + B_{ij}\sin\theta_{ij}) V_j - \sum_{k \in \mathcal{S}_i} P_{\mathrm{g}k} + P_{\mathrm{d}i}.
```

In this equation, the set ``\mathcal{S}_i \subseteq \mathcal S`` encompasses all generators connected to bus ``i \in \mathcal N``, and ``P_{\mathrm{g}k}`` represents the active power output of the ``k``-th generator within the set ``\mathcal{S}_i``. More precisely, the variable ``P_{\mathrm{g}k}`` represents the optimization variable, along with the bus voltage angles ``\theta_{ij} = \theta_i - \theta_j`` and the bus voltage magnitudes ``V_i`` and ``V_j``.

The constant term is determined by the active power demand ``P_{\mathrm{d}i}`` at bus ``i \in \mathcal{N}``. The values representing this constant term, denoted as ``\mathbf{P}_{\mathrm{d}} = [P_{\mathrm{d}i}]`` can be accessed using the following:
```@repl ACOptimalPowerFlow
ùêè‚Çí = system.bus.demand.active
```

We can access the references to the active power balance constraints using the following snippet:
```@repl ACOptimalPowerFlow
print(analysis.method.constraint.balance.active)
```

---

Similarly, the next constraint in the optimization problem is associated with the reactive power balance equation:
```math
\begin{aligned}
h_{Q_i}(\mathbf Q_\mathrm{g}, \mathbf V, \bm \Theta) = 0,\;\;\; i \in \mathcal N.
\end{aligned}
```

As elaborated in the [Bus Injections](@ref BusInjectionsTutorials) section, we can express the equation as follows:
```math
h_{Q_i}(\mathbf Q_\mathrm{g}, \mathbf V, \bm \Theta ) = V_i \sum\limits_{j=1}^n (G_{ij}\sin\theta_{ij} - B_{ij}\cos\theta_{ij}) V_j - \sum_{k \in \mathcal{S}_i} Q_{\mathrm{g}k} + Q_{\mathrm{d}i}.
```

As mentioned earlier for active power, ``Q_{\mathrm{g}k}`` represents the reactive power output of the ``k``-th generator within the set ``\mathcal{S}_i``. The variable ``Q_{\mathrm{g}k}`` serves as an optimization variable, as well as the bus voltage angles ``\theta_{ij} = \theta_i - \theta_j``, and the bus voltage magnitudes ``V_i`` and ``V_j``.

The constant term is determined by the reactive power demand ``Q_{\mathrm{d}i}`` at bus ``i \in \mathcal{N}``. The values representing this constant term, denoted as ``\mathbf{Q}_{\mathrm{d}} = [Q_{\mathrm{d}i}]`` can be accessed using the following:
```@repl ACOptimalPowerFlow
ùêê‚Çí = system.bus.demand.reactive
```

We can access the references to the reactive power balance constraints using the following snippet:
```@repl ACOptimalPowerFlow
print(analysis.method.constraint.balance.reactive)
```

---

##### Bus Voltage Constraints
The inequality constraints associated with the voltage magnitude ensure that the bus voltage magnitudes are within specified limits:
```math
V_i^\mathrm{min} \leq V_i \leq V_i^\mathrm{max},\;\;\; i \in \mathcal N,
```
where ``V_i^\mathrm{min}`` represents the minimum voltage magnitude, and ``V_i^\mathrm{max}`` represents the maximum voltage magnitude for bus ``i \in \mathcal N``. The values representing these voltage magnitude limits, denoted as ``\mathbf V_\mathrm{lm} = [V_i^\mathrm{min}, V_i^\mathrm{max}]`` can be accessed using the following:
```@repl ACOptimalPowerFlow
ùêï‚Çó‚Çò = [system.bus.voltage.minMagnitude system.bus.voltage.maxMagnitude]
```

To retrieve this inequality constraint from the model, we can use the following:
```@repl ACOptimalPowerFlow
print(analysis.method.constraint.voltage.magnitude)
```

---

The inequality constraint related to the minimum and maximum bus voltage angle difference between the from-bus and to-bus ends of each branch is defined as follows:
```math
\theta_{ij}^\mathrm{min} \leq \theta_i - \theta_j \leq \theta_{ij}^\mathrm{max},\;\;\; (i,j) \in \mathcal{E},
```
where ``\theta_{ij}^\mathrm{min}`` represents the minimum, while ``\theta_{ij}^\mathrm{max}`` represents the maximum of the angle difference between adjacent buses of the branch ``(i,j) \in \mathcal{E}``. The values representing the voltage angle difference, denoted as ``\bm \Theta_\mathrm{lm} = [\theta_{ij}^\mathrm{min}, \theta_{ij}^\mathrm{max}]``, are provided as follows:
```@repl ACOptimalPowerFlow
ùöØ‚Çó‚Çò = [system.branch.voltage.minDiffAngle system.branch.voltage.maxDiffAngle]
```

To retrieve this inequality constraint from the model, we can use the following:
```@repl ACOptimalPowerFlow
print(analysis.method.constraint.voltage.angle)
```

---

##### Branch Flow Constraints
The inequality constraints related to the branch flows can be associated with the limits on apparent power flow, active power flow, or current magnitude at the from-bus and to-bus ends of each branch. The type of constraint applied is determined by the `type` keyword within the [`addBranch!`](@ref addBranch!) function.

The `type` value defines the constraint as follows: `type = 1` applies to active power flow; `type = 2` and `type = 3` apply to apparent power flow; and `type = 4` and `type = 5` apply to current magnitude. When `type = 3` or `type = 5` is selected, squared inequality constraints are used. These constraints typically provide a more numerically robust optimization problem but often result in slower convergence compared to the non-squared versions.

These constraints are mathematically expressed through the equations ``h_{ij}(\mathbf V, \bm \Theta)`` and ``h_{ji}(\mathbf V, \bm \Theta)``, representing the flow constraints at the from-bus and to-bus ends of each branch, respectively:
```math
\begin{aligned}
    F_{ij}^{\mathrm{min}} \leq h_{ij}(\mathbf V, \bm \Theta) \leq F_{ij}^{\mathrm{max}},\;\;\; (i,j) \in \mathcal{E} \\
    F_{ji}^{\mathrm{min}} \leq h_{ji}(\mathbf V, \bm \Theta) \leq F_{ji}^{\mathrm{max}},\;\;\; (i,j) \in \mathcal{E}.
\end{aligned}
```

The branch flow limits at the from-bus and to-bus ends of the branch ``(i,j) \in \mathcal{E}``, denoted as ``\mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{f}} = [F_{ij}^\mathrm{min}, F_{ij}^\mathrm{max}]`` and ``\mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{t}} = [F_{ji}^\mathrm{min}, F_{ji}^\mathrm{max}]``, can be retrieved as follows:
```@repl ACOptimalPowerFlow
ùêÖ‚Çí = [system.branch.flow.minFromBus system.branch.flow.maxFromBus]
ùêÖ‚Çú = [system.branch.flow.minToBus system.branch.flow.maxToBus]
```

---

The first option is to define the limit keywords for active power flow constraints (`type = 1`) at the from-bus and to-bus ends of each branch:
```math
  \begin{aligned}
    h_{ij}(\mathbf V, \bm \Theta) &= \cfrac{g_{ij} + g_{\mathrm{s}ij}}{\tau_{ij}^2} V_i^2 -
    \cfrac{1}{\tau_{ij}} \left[g_{ij}\cos(\theta_{ij} - \phi_{ij}) + b_{ij}\sin(\theta_{ij} - \phi_{ij})\right] V_i V_j \\
    h_{ji}(\mathbf V, \bm{\Theta}) &= (g_{ij} + g_{\mathrm{s}ij}) V_j^2 -
    \cfrac{1}{\tau_{ij}} \left[g_{ij} \cos(\theta_{ij} - \phi_{ij}) - b_{ij} \sin(\theta_{ij}- \phi_{ij})\right] V_i V_j.
  \end{aligned}
```

In our example, we have chosen to utilize this type of flow constraints. To access the flow constraints of branches at the from-bus end, users can use the following code snippet:
```@repl ACOptimalPowerFlow
print(analysis.method.constraint.flow.from)
```

Similarly, to access the to-bus end flow constraints of branches users can use the following code snippet:
```@repl ACOptimalPowerFlow
print(analysis.method.constraint.flow.to)
```

---

The second option applies constraints to the apparent power flow (`type = 2`). This constraint at the from-bus is specified as:
```math
    h_{ij}(\mathbf V, \bm \Theta) =
    \sqrt{A_{ij} V_i^4 + B_{ij} V_i^2 V_j^2 - 2 [C_{ij} \cos(\theta_{ij} - \phi_{ij}) - D_{ij} \sin(\theta_{ij} - \phi_{ij})] V_i^3 V_j},
```
where:
```math
  \begin{gathered}
    A_{ij} = \cfrac{(g_{ij} + g_{\mathrm{s}i})^2 + (b_{ij} + b_{\mathrm{s}i})^2}{\tau_{ij}^4}, \;\;\;
    B_{ij} = \cfrac{g_{ij}^2 + b_{ij}^2}{\tau_{ij}^2} \\
    C_{ij} = \cfrac{g_{ij}(g_{ij} + g_{\mathrm{s}i}) + b_{ij}(b_{ij} + b_{\mathrm{s}i})}{\tau_{ij}^3}, \;\;\;
    D_{ij} = \cfrac{g_{ij}b_{\mathrm{s}i} - b_{ij}g_{\mathrm{s}i}}{\tau_{ij}^3}.
  \end{gathered}
```

Furthermore, this constraint at the to-bus is specified as:
```math
    h_{ji}(\mathbf {V}, \bm{\Theta}) =
    \sqrt{A_{ji} V_j^4 + B_{ji} V_i^2 V_j^2 - 2 [C_{ji} \cos(\theta_{ij} - \phi_{ij}) + D_{ji} \sin(\theta_{ij} - \phi_{ij})] V_i V_j^3  },
```
where:
```math
  \begin{gathered}
    A_{ji} = (g_{ij} + g_{\mathrm{s}i})^2 + (b_{ij} + b_{\mathrm{s}i})^2, \;\;\;
    B_{ji} = \cfrac{g_{ij}^2 + b_{ij}^2}{\tau_{ij}^2} \\
    C_{ji} = \cfrac{g_{ij}(g_{ij} + g_{\mathrm{s}i}) + b_{ij}(b_{ij} + b_{\mathrm{s}i})}{\tau_{ij}}, \;\;\;
    D_{ji} = \cfrac{g_{ij}b_{\mathrm{s}i} - b_{ij}g_{\mathrm{s}i}}{\tau_{ij}}.
  \end{gathered}
```

If users choose `type = 3`, it means that the equations are squared (i.e., the square root is omitted), and the limit values will also be squared accordingly.

---

The last option involves defining the limit keywords for current magnitude constraints (`type = 4`) at the from-bus and to-bus ends of each branch. In this case, the constraints are implemented as follows:
```math
  \begin{aligned}
    h_{ij}(\mathbf V, \bm \Theta) &= \sqrt{A_{ij}V_i^2 + B_{ij}V_j^2 - 2[C_{ij} \cos(\theta_{ij} - \phi_{ij}) - D_{ij}\sin(\theta_{ij} - \phi_{ij})] V_iV_j} \\
    h_{ji}(\mathbf V, \bm \Theta) &= \sqrt{A_{ji}V_j^2 + B_{ji}V_i^2 - 2[C_{ji} \cos(\theta_{ij} - \phi_{ij}) + D_{ji}\sin(\theta_{ij} - \phi_{ij})] V_iV_j}.
  \end{aligned}
```

If users choose `type = 5`, it means that the equations are squared (i.e., the square root is omitted), and the limit values will also be squared accordingly.

---

##### [Generator Power Capability Constraints](@id ACPowerCapabilityConstraintsTutorials)
The next set of constraints pertains to the minimum and maximum limits of active and reactive power outputs of the generators. These constraints ensure that the power outputs of the generators remain within specified bounds:
```math
P_{\mathrm{g}i}^\mathrm{min} \leq P_{\mathrm{g}i} \leq P_{\mathrm{g}i}^\mathrm{max} ,\;\;\; i \in \mathcal{S}.
```

In this representation, the lower and upper limits are determined by the vector ``\mathbf P_\mathrm{m} = [P_{\mathrm{g}i}^\mathrm{min}, P_{\mathrm{g}i}^\mathrm{max}]``, ``i \in \mathcal{S}``. We can access these bounds using the following:
```@repl ACOptimalPowerFlow
ùêè‚Çò = [system.generator.capability.minActive, system.generator.capability.maxActive]
```

To access these constraints, you can utilize the following snippet:
```@repl ACOptimalPowerFlow
print(analysis.method.constraint.capability.active)
```

---

Similarly, constraints related to the minimum and maximum limits of reactive power outputs of the generators ensure that the reactive powers remain within specified boundaries:
```math
Q_{\mathrm{g}i}^\mathrm{min} \leq Q_{\mathrm{g}i} \leq Q_{\mathrm{g}i}^\mathrm{max} ,\;\;\; i \in \mathcal{S}.
```

Thus, the lower and upper limits are determined by the vector ``\mathbf Q_\mathrm{m} = [Q_{\mathrm{g}i}^\mathrm{min}, Q_{\mathrm{g}i}^\mathrm{max}]``, ``i \in \mathcal S``. We can access these bounds using the following:
```@repl ACOptimalPowerFlow
ùêê‚Çò = [system.generator.capability.minReactive system.generator.capability.maxReactive]
```

To access these constraints, you can use the following snippet:
```@repl ACOptimalPowerFlow
print(analysis.method.constraint.capability.reactive)
```

---

These capability limits of the generators define the feasible region, represented as a gray area in Figure 3, which forms the solution space for the active and reactive output powers of the generators.
```@raw html
<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="../../assets/pq_curve.svg" width="350"/>
    <p>Figure 3: Feasible region defined by power capability constraints.</p>

&nbsp;
```

However, this representation might not be the most accurate depiction of the generator's output power behavior. In reality, there exists a tradeoff between the active and reactive power outputs of the generators [zimmerman2016matpower](@cite). Specifically, when a generator operates at its maximum active power ``P_{\mathrm{g}i}^\mathrm{max}``, it may not be able to produce the maximum ``Q_{\mathrm{g}i}^\mathrm{max}`` or minimum ``Q_{\mathrm{g}i}^\mathrm{min}`` reactive power. To capture this tradeoff, we introduce the ability to include additional upper and lower constraints on the feasible region, leading to its reduction as shown in Figure 4.
```@raw html
<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="../../assets/pq_curve_sloped.svg" width="350"/>
    <p>Figure 4: Feasible region defined by power capability and boundary constraints.</p>
</div>
&nbsp;
```

If a user wishes to incorporate the tradeoff between active and reactive power outputs into the optimization model, they can define the points shown in Figure 4 within the [`addGenerator!`](@ref addGenerator!) function using the following keywords:

| Keyword           | Coordinate                                    |
|:------------------|:----------------------------------------------|
| `lowActive`       | ``P_{\mathrm{g}i}^\mathrm{low}``              |
| `minLowReactive`  | ``Q_{\mathrm{g}i,\mathrm{low}}^\mathrm{min}`` |
| `maxLowReactive`  | ``Q_{\mathrm{g}i,\mathrm{low}}^\mathrm{max}`` |
| `upActive`        | ``P_{\mathrm{g}i}^\mathrm{up}``               |
| `minUpReactive`   | ``Q_{\mathrm{g}i,\mathrm{up}}^\mathrm{min}``  |
| `maxUpReactive`   | ``Q_{\mathrm{g}i,\mathrm{up}}^\mathrm{max}``  |

When using these points, JuliaGrid constructs two additional capability constraints per generator as follows:
```math
\begin{aligned}
    (Q_{\mathrm{g}i,\mathrm{low}}^\mathrm{max} - Q_{\mathrm{g}i,\mathrm{up}}^\mathrm{max})P_{\mathrm{g}i} +
    (P_{\mathrm{g}i}^\mathrm{up} - P_{\mathrm{g}i}^\mathrm{low})Q_{\mathrm{g}i}
    \leq (Q_{\mathrm{g}i,\mathrm{low}}^\mathrm{max} - Q_{\mathrm{g}i,\mathrm{up}}^\mathrm{max})P_{\mathrm{g}i}^\mathrm{low} +
    (P_{\mathrm{g}i}^\mathrm{up} - P_{\mathrm{g}i}^\mathrm{low})Q_{\mathrm{g}i,\mathrm{low}}^\mathrm{max} \\
    (Q_{\mathrm{g}i,\mathrm{up}}^\mathrm{min} - Q_{\mathrm{g}i,\mathrm{low}}^\mathrm{min})P_{\mathrm{g}i} +
    (P_{\mathrm{g}i}^\mathrm{low} - P_{\mathrm{g}i}^\mathrm{up})Q_{\mathrm{g}i}
    \leq (Q_{\mathrm{g}i,\mathrm{up}}^\mathrm{min} - Q_{\mathrm{g}i,\mathrm{low}}^\mathrm{min})P_{\mathrm{g}i}^\mathrm{low} +
    (P_{\mathrm{g}i}^\mathrm{low} - P_{\mathrm{g}i}^\mathrm{up})Q_{\mathrm{g}i,\mathrm{low}}^\mathrm{min}.
\end{aligned}
```

To ensure numerical stability, these constraints are normalized by introducing two scaling factors:
```math
\begin{aligned}
    s_1 = \sqrt{(Q_{\mathrm{g}i,\mathrm{low}}^\mathrm{max} - Q_{\mathrm{g}i,\mathrm{up}}^\mathrm{max})^2 +
    (P_{\mathrm{g}i}^\mathrm{up} - P_{\mathrm{g}i}^\mathrm{low})^2}\\
    s_2 = \sqrt{(Q_{\mathrm{g}i,\mathrm{up}}^\mathrm{min} - Q_{\mathrm{g}i,\mathrm{low}}^\mathrm{min})^2 +
    (P_{\mathrm{g}i}^\mathrm{low} - P_{\mathrm{g}i}^\mathrm{up})^2}.
\end{aligned}
```

When these constraints exist in the system, users can access them using the following variables:
```@example ACOptimalPowerFlow
analysis.method.constraint.capability.upper
analysis.method.constraint.capability.lower
nothing # hide
```

These additional capability constraints allow us to accurately represent the tradeoff between active and reactive power outputs of the generators while maintaining numerical stability.

## [Optimal Power Flow Solution](@id ACOptimalPowerFlowSolutionTutorials)
To obtain the optimal values of active and reactive power outputs for generators and the bus voltage magnitudes and angles, the user needs to invoke the following function:
```@example ACOptimalPowerFlow
JuMP.set_silent(analysis.method.jump) # hide
solve!(system, analysis)
nothing # hide
```

After solving the AC optimal power flow problem, you can retrieve the vectors of output active and reactive power for generators, denoted as ``\mathbf P_\mathrm{g} = [P_{\mathrm{g}i}]`` and ``\mathbf Q_\mathrm{g} = [Q_{\mathrm{g}i}]``, where ``i \in \mathcal S``, using the following commands:
```@repl ACOptimalPowerFlow
ùêè‚Çí = analysis.power.generator.active
ùêê‚Çí = analysis.power.generator.reactive
```

Similarly, the resulting bus voltage magnitudes and angles, represented by ``\mathbf V = [V_i]`` and ``\bm \Theta = [\theta_i]``, where ``i \in \mathcal N``, are stored in the vectors as follows:
```@repl ACOptimalPowerFlow
ùêï = analysis.voltage.magnitude
ùöØ = analysis.voltage.angle
```

By accessing these vectors, you can analyze and utilize the optimal power flow solution for further studies or operational decision-making in the power system.

## [Power Analysis](@id ACOptimalPowerAnalysisTutorials)

##### [Generator Power Injections](@id OptGeneratorPowerInjectionsManual)
The [`power!`](@ref power!(::PowerSystem, ::ACPowerFlow)) function in JuliaGrid also provides the computation of active and reactive power injections from the generators at each bus. To calculate the active power supplied by generators to the buses, one can simply sum the active power outputs of the generators obtained from the AC optimal power flow. This can be represented as:
```math
    P_{\mathrm{p}i} = \sum_{k \in \mathcal S_i} P_{\mathrm{g}k},\;\;\; i \in \mathcal N,
```
where the set ``\mathcal{S}_i \subseteq \mathcal S`` encompasses all generators connected to bus ``i \in \mathcal N``. The active power injections from the generators at each bus are stored as a vector denoted by ``\mathbf P_\mathrm{p} = [P_{\mathrm{p}i}]``, and can be obtained using:
```@repl ACOptimalPowerFlow
ùêè‚Çö = analysis.power.supply.active
```

Similarly, we can obtain the reactive power supplied by generators to the buses:
```math
    Q_{\mathrm{p}i} = \sum_{k \in \mathcal S_i} Q_{\mathrm{g}k},\;\;\; i \in \mathcal N.
```
The vector of these reactive power injections by the generators to the buses, denoted by ``\mathbf Q_\mathrm{p} = [Q_{\mathrm{p}i}]``, can be retrieved using the following command:
```@repl ACOptimalPowerFlow
ùêê‚Çö = analysis.power.supply.reactive
```

To retrieve these powers in JuliaGrid, use the following commands:
```@repl ACOptimalPowerFlow
ùêè‚Çõ‚Çï = analysis.power.shunt.active
ùêê‚Çõ‚Çï = analysis.power.shunt.reactive
```

---

##### Power Flows
The resulting [active and reactive power flows](@ref BranchNetworkEquationsTutorials) at each from-bus end are stored as the vectors ``\mathbf P_\mathrm{i} = [P_{ij}]`` and ``\mathbf Q_\mathrm{i} = [Q_{ij}],`` respectively, and can be retrieved using the following commands:
```@repl ACOptimalPowerFlow
ùêè·µ¢ = analysis.power.from.active
ùêê·µ¢ = analysis.power.from.reactive
```

Similarly, the vectors of [active and reactive power flows](@ref BranchNetworkEquationsTutorials) at each to-bus end are stored as ``\mathbf P_\mathrm{j} = [P_{ji}]`` and ``\mathbf Q_\mathrm{j} = [Q_{ji}]``, respectively, and can be retrieved using the following code:
```@repl ACOptimalPowerFlow
ùêè‚±º = analysis.power.to.active
ùêê‚±º = analysis.power.to.reactive
```

---

##### Power at Branch Shunt Elements
[Active and reactive powers](@ref BranchShuntElementsTutorials) associated with the branch shunt elements at each branch are represented by the vectors ``\mathbf P_\mathrm{s} = [P_{\mathrm{s}ij}]`` and ``\mathbf Q_\mathrm{s} = [Q_{\mathrm{s}ij}]``. We can retrieve these values using the following code:
```@repl ACOptimalPowerFlow
ùêè‚Çõ = analysis.power.charging.active
ùêê‚Çõ = analysis.power.charging.reactive
```

---

##### Power at Branch Series Elements
[Active and reactive powers](@ref BranchSeriesElementTutorials) associated with the branch series element at each branch are represented by the vectors ``\mathbf P_\mathrm{l} = [P_{\mathrm{l}ij}]`` and ``\mathbf Q_\mathrm{l} = [Q_{\mathrm{l}ij}]``. We can retrieve these values using the following code:
```@repl ACOptimalPowerFlow
ùêè‚Çó = analysis.power.series.active
ùêê‚Çó = analysis.power.series.reactive
```

## Current Analysis
JuliaGrid offers the [`current!`](@ref current!(::PowerSystem, ::AC)) function, which enables the calculation of currents associated with buses and branches. Here is an example code snippet demonstrating its usage:
```@example ACOptimalPowerFlow
current!(system, analysis)
nothing # hide
```

The function stores the computed currents in the polar coordinate system. It calculates the following currents related to buses and branches:
